What is certification?
Certification is a great path to a high-paying career in some of the best jobs in the world without spending thousands of dollars to attend a four-year college. The process is actually quite simple. Candidates choose a certificate they want such as CCNA. They train it, pay [ExamTopicsFree](https://examtopicsfree.com/) a fee to take an exam, fulfill a list of requirements, and voila! They are certified in a specific field. There are hundreds of certifications in almost every subject related to advanced skills. From networking with Cisco to running a cloud server with Amazon AWS, certifications exist at every level of the industry.

Why would I want to get certified?
You may know the “what” of certifications, but you are probably wondering “why” they are important. Did you know that millions of high-tech jobs went unpaid in 0? Employers are desperate to hire qualified workers who have tangible proof that they can do the job well. Imagine working in an office making $0,000 or $0,000 a year, after spending just a few tough months getting certified. With certifications from vendors like CompTIA, this is a reality. Even better, the certification journey never stops. It's a lifelong process where you can test, study, and earn more certifications to improve your skills and increase your value as an employee. Some certificates like ISACA take years to earn, but you earn a six-figure sum each year and are a hot commodity.

What does Certification mean?
Finding a job in the tech industry is not difficult if you have good skills. Demonstrating this skill set is nearly impossible. [Exam Topics Free](https://examtopicsfree.com/) You can't show up to the interview and say, "I'm good with computers."

Without industry-approved certification from a vendor like Microsoft, employers can't trust your knowledge. Even better, these certificates aren't just a piece of paper. Getting A+ certified is hard work, but it automatically tells employers that you have a real, tried and tested skill set. They teach great skills that will make your job easier and more rewarding. Whether it's a Cyber Security certification like Security+ or an MCSD certification, these complex certifications take time, effort, and offer huge rewards!
